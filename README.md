### Hi there!

I'm focused on learning game development, and have been studying:
-🎮 game design
-💻 programming
-🔊 sound design
-🎨 pixel art


📚 At the moment I'm busy with CS50's game development course.


🧲 You can find my games at https://michelxrf.itch.io/. Nothing special there (__yet!__) though.
